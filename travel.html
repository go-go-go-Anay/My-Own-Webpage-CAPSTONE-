        <h2 id="text">International:</h2>
        <h3 id="text">Talking about International trips, my favourite destination is Paris.
            It is home to one of the seven wonders of the world, The Eiffel Tower. 
            we had the opportunity to climb to the top of the top of the tower, and
            so we did, our minds were blown away by the beauty of paris.
            afterwards, we went to, wait for it, Disney Land! We had lots of fun playing on rides, 
            eating, buying aicky mouse accessories,shopping. In case you are wondering, 
            yes this is where Micky mouse and Lightning mcqueen characters were designed.

            Apart from this, I have also visited Singapore, Italy and Sri Lanka to name just a few.
